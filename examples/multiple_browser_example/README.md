This example showcases how to run tests in multiple environments. In this case we want to run some Selenium tests in a couple of browsers. This is done by adding the 'environments' list to the configuration file.

You can run this test from the root directory of the project using:
    ./egatest -c examples/multiple_browser_example/multiple_browsers.json
